# 1.0.7
- fixed 'powered kiln' recipes to support vanilla items
- 'item compound producer' is no longer WIP
- 'fluid solidifier' JEI screen got an update

# 1.0.8
- added 'fluid compound producer' (combines fluids into other fluids)
- added config files for extra recipes to various machines
    - "{registry_name}-base.json" - this is the default recipes config generated by the mod
    - "{registry_name}-extra.json" - extra recipes file that is loaded, if it exists, but will never be created/overwrited by the mod
    - check "-base.json" files for examples of the recipe structure
